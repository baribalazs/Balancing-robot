# Balancing-robot

This will be the Final Project at my last year.

Goal: balancing robot with 2 ultrasonic sensorrs, 2 stepper motors and controller, 1 gyro sensor, 1 pi camera mounted on a 2 servo tilt-turn platform and if power is enough a Kinect sensor. Data is streamed to a website. The robot can be controlled from bluetooth or from the website via game controller.
